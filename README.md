## Criteria for minesweeper

When a function's cyclomatic complexity goes from above or equals to 10 to below 10.

## Test Description

This repo tests if we can correctly compute a developer's minesweeper grade if they have multiple emails. Here's the setup:

- Developer A has three emails: a1@merico.dev, a2@merico.dev, and a3@merico.dev
- Developer B has one email: b@merico.dev 
- Each of developer A's emails swept 1 mine
- Developer B's only email swept 2 mines

So if we merge emails correctly, developer A would be ranked No.1 for minesweeper badge.
